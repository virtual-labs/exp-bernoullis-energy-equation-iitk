Bernoulli’s equation assumes that the flow is steady, incompressible and friction losses are negligible. These assumptions are also based on the laws of conservation of mass and energy.  Bernoulli’s equation states that the “sum of the kinetic energy (velocity head), the pressure energy (static head) and Potential energy (elevation head) per unit weight of the fluid at any point remains constant” provided the flow is steady, irrotational, and frictionless and the fluid used is incompressible. This is however, on the assumption that energy is neither added to nor taken away by some external agency. The key approximation in the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation is that viscous effects are negligibly small compared to inertial, gravitational, and pressure effects </br>

We can write the theorem for stations 1,2 and 3 (see Fig. 4) as:<br>
P<sub>1</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g+Z<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g+Z<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g +Z<sub>3</sub> <br>
Where frictional losses hf = 0, is assumed to be negligible as compared to inertial, gravitational and pressure effects.<br>
Since pipe is horizontally placed hence,  Z<sub>1</sub>=Z<sub>2</sub>=Z<sub>3</sub>,hence:<br>
P<sub>1</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g= P<sub>2</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g=P<sub>3</sub>/ρg+(V<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2g<br>   
Or rewriting the above equation:
P<sub>1</sub>+(〖ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2= P<sub>2</sub>+(〖ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2 = P<sub>3</sub>+(〖ρV<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2=Constant<br>
P is the static pressure since it does not incorporate any dynamic effects<br>
(ρV<sup>2</sup>)/2  is the dynamic pressure<br>
ρgZ is the hydrostatic pressure (is omitted in this case as pipe is horizontally placed). Its value depends on the reference level selected; it accounts for the elevation effects<br>
The sum of the static, dynamic pressures and hydrostatic pressure is called the total pressure. In other words, the Bernoulli equation states that the total pressure along a streamline is constant. The sum of the static and dynamic pressures is called the stagnation pressure, and it is expressed as:<br>
P<sub>Stagnation</sub>=P+(ρV<sup>2</sup>)/2
